SUBMITTING UPDATES
==================

We rely on users of the database to submit corrections and additions to keep 
the list as accurate and complete as possible. The most convenient method
of submitting them is via the movie mail-server's central collection service. 
For a comprehensive guide send an e-mail message with the subject: 

  HELP ADD FULL

to <mail-server@imdb.com>. 

The instructions specific to the actors list are given below.


KEYWORD INTERFACE
=================

This is the most flexible interface but can appear quite complex if you aren't
familiar with the organization of the database. 

Additions
---------

(1) mark the start of the data with the word:

    ACTOR

(2) for each addition, include on a separate line an entry of the form:

     <name>|<title>|<attributes>|<character name>|<order>

    where:

     <name> is the actors name in <surname>, <firstname> order. Please note
            the space after the comma as in: "Grant, Cary". 

     <title> is the title of the movie or TV-series in which the actor 
             appeared, please include the year of release as part of the title
             (see examples below).

     <attributes> records any award nominations or wins and in most cases will
                  be empty. Example attributes include:

       (AA)           = academy award winner (best actor)
       (AAN)          = academy award nominee (best actor)
       (S:AA)         = academy award winner (best supporting actor)
       (S:AAN)        = academy award nominee (best supporting actor)
       (GG)           = golden globe winner (best drama actor)
       (GGN)          = golden globe nominee (best drama actor)

     <character name>  is the character name of the actor.

     <order> is a number to record the position in which the actor appears in
             the credits (1=star billing)

    The full additions guide contains more information on the formats. 

    Notes:

     - Apart from the <name> and <title> all these fields are optional, but
       please leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some
       of the data may be lost.

     - Guest appearances in TV-series are NOT eligible for the main actors and
       actresses list. The person must have played a recurring role across a 
       number of episodes in order to be included. See the section describing
       the biography database for an alternative method of adding this type of 
       information.

     - Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of
       a particular rock group appeared in a movie then include them under 
       their individual names and not the name of the whole group.

     - The actors and actresses sections are for people only. No animals.

    Examples:

    ACTOR
    Grant, Cary|North by Northwest (1959)||Rogert Thornhill|1
    Grant, Cary|Awful Truth, The (1937)|||1
    Grant, Cary|Philadelphia Story, The (1940)|||
    Hopkins, Anthony|Silence of the Lambs, The (1990)|(AA)||

(3) If the additions include a title that is new to the database, please also 
    include a section of the form:

    TITLE
    <title>|<year>|

    Example:
    
    TITLE
    North by Northwest (1959)|1959|
    Silence of the Lambs, The (1960)|1990|

(4) Mark the end of your data with the word

    END

    on a separate line.

(5) Mail the data to <add@imdb.com>. The mail-server will mail a receipt back
    to you and place the data in the queue for processing by the list managers 
    in the next update.


Character Name Additions
------------------------

If you wish to add character names to *existing* entries in the database only,
use the keyword:

  CHARA

and the format:

  <name>|<title>|<character name>


Cast Ordering Additions
-----------------------

If you wish to add cast ordering information to *existing* entries in the 
database only, use the keyword:

  ORDER

and the format:

  <name>|<title>|<order>


Deletions
---------

To delete an incorrect entry on the list, the format is similar to those 
described above, but a '!' character is placed at the start of each entry. The
format is:

ACTOR
!<name>|<title>|

For example:

ACTOR
!Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|


Corrections
-----------

(1) Correcting a name across the whole database

    If you spot a spelling error in a name in the database, use the keyword

      NAMECORRECT

    and the format:

      <current name>|<correct name>

    For example:

      NAMECORRECT
      Bogart, Humphry|Bogart, Humphrey|

(2) Replacing an individual entry

    Replacements can be made by deleting the incorrect entry and adding the 
    correct version. For example:

      ACTOR
      !Grant, Cary|Notorious (1992) (TV)|
      Grant, Cary|Notorious (1946)|||

(3) Other corrections

    Finally, if your correction cannot be expressed in the forms above, use
    the keyword:

      CORRECT

    and then include a description of your correction in a free text over as
    many lines as you need.
