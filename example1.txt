This text file contains some examples of valid and invalid e-mail
addresses, adapted from Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_address

(Note that we are using a simpler specification than the official one
described in Wikipedia.  For the purposes of this assignment, use the
specification given in the "Input" section of the assignment.)

Here are some valid examples:
A typical e-mail: Abc@example.com
You can put dots in the user name: Abc.123@example.com
The user name can even be all numbers! 1234567890@domain.com
The domain name may contain hyphens abcd@example-one.com
_______@domain.com  Honestly, all underscores might not work in real life

Some invalid examples:
Here there is no @ symbol: Abc.example.com
You can't end the local address with a dot:  Abc.@example.com
And you can't have two dots in a row   Abc..123@example.com

Note that not every domain name is required to have multiple parts,
like in the typical Abc@example.com.  For the purposes of this
assignment, you should also pick out addresses such as root@localhost.
Note that your script should pick out the two e-mail addresses in this
paragraph, even though they are followed by periods, because the
periods are part of the sentence containing the address, not the
address itself.
